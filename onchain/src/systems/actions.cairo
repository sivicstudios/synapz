        /// This function handles the progression of a trivia game to the subsequent question. It
        /// can be triggered by the game host or automatically after the timer for the current
        /// question expires. The function performs the following steps:
        /// - Retrieves the current world state.
        /// - Identifies the caller of the function.
        /// - Reads the `Game` model associated with the provided `game_id`.
        /// - Asserts that the game's status is `GameStatus::InProgress`; the game must be running
        ///   to advance to the next question.
        /// - Asserts that either the caller is the game host or the current block timestamp is
        ///   after the `timer_end` of the current question. This allows the host to manually
        ///   advance, or the game to proceed automatically after the time limit.
        /// - Reads the `TriviaInfo` model associated with the game's `trivia_id` to get the total
        ///   number of questions.
        /// - Checks if the index of the next question (`game.current_question + 1`) exceeds or
        ///   equals the total number of questions in the trivia:
        ///   - If it does, the game is considered finished. The game's `status` is updated to
        ///     `GameStatus::Ended`, the `timer_end` is reset to 0, and a `GameEnded` event is
        ///     emitted.
        ///   - If there are more questions, the `game.current_question` index is incremented. The
        ///     next `Question` model is read using the `trivia_id` and the new `current_question`
        ///     index. The `timer_end` for the next question is set to the current block timestamp
        ///     plus the `time_limit` of the new question.
        /// - Emits a `NextQuestion` event, indicating the index of the current question and the
        ///   `game_id`.
        /// - Persists the updated `Game` model to the world state.
